# SignIT

As part of a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering me and my partner came up with the idea of SignIT.

SignIT is an R&D project that translates English into American Sign Language, SignIT gets a Real-Time voice recording or an existing audio file as input, and displays a gramatically correct ASL sentence as ouptut.

During the first phase we have conducted a research about several subjects such as : Google Speech Recognition API, WordNet, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Apache OpenNLP, Natural Language Generation (NLG), simpleNLG and ASL Linguistics.

Research Phase Outcome : Activity Diagram, Conceptual Diagram, NLP Workflow Diagram, GUI, Working Prototype (Translate RT recording into ASL).

Already Implemented : Speech Recognition, Output Display.
